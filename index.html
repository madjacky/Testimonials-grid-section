I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p><p class="testimonial__text">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p></article></li><li class="testimonials__item" data-item="two"><article class="testimonial" data-author="jonathan"><header class="testimonial__header"><img loading="lazy" src="img/image-jonathan.jpg" class="image testimonial__author-avatar" width="28" height="28" alt="Jonathan Walters"><div class="testimonial__author"><h2 class="testimonial__author-name">Jonathan Walters</h2><p class="testimonial__author-position">Verified Graduate</p></div></header><p class="testimonial__cite">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</p><p class="testimonial__text">“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills.

Highly recommended!</p><p class="testimonial__text">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p></article></li></ul></div></section></main><footer class="footer"><div class="container footer__container"></div></footer></body></html>
